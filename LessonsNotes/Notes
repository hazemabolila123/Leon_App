    Why we use containers ?
    1- because if we gave styles to the parent div (width: 600px), 
    it will applied to the parent div so we will have a parent div in center with width = 600px and the 100% - 600px will be in another color which makes a bad user experience, so we add a conatiner in the parent to centeralize its contents without changing the parent div.   
    2- We will have a design pattern for all our elementes

    How we use the container ?
    - by adding a container inside the the parent div and giving it
    (1) margin from left and right to centeralize it in the in the large screens
    (2) padding from left and right to hava a spce from the screen in small screens such as mobile 
    (3) and specify its width in @media to achieve responsive design requirments and prevent the container from scrolled.

    code :
    .parent {
    background-color: #eee;
    }

    .container {
        margin: 0px auto;
        background-color: #ccc;
        padding: 0px 15px;
    }

    /* Small Screens */
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
        .container {
            width: 750px;
        }
    }

    /* Medium Screens */
    @media (min-width: 992px) {
        .container {
            width: 970px;
        }
    }

    /* Large Screens */
    @media (min-width: 1200px) {
        .container {
            width: 1170px;
        }
    }
